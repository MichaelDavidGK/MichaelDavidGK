I'm Mikey

This is my "whenever free" account

That means I use this account whenever I'm free and feel like it

ðŸ¤” I sometimes make random bug reports I found, fix small issues (PR), adjust or optimise code

ðŸ¥² I'm not really active here as I mostly help people on discord servers, doing some stuff on crowdin or work

ðŸ“« Feel free to message me on discord, I have DMs locked so just click [here](https://discord.gg/jDMuU9NbfE) and it will take you to my discord server

For the less formal side:

I love to stay home or go somewhere cosy

I enjoy playing games with friends or while talking with them

However I hate playing alone as I am getting bored easily and it's no fun

Whenever bored I will start tinkering with something irl or some code, often help people

I rest by watching something, be it movie, latest series, anime or even some simple youtube video

From more recreational part I enjoy skying, roller skating, biking and going to gym, I go there daily ðŸ˜…
